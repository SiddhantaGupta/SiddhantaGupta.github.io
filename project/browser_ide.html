    <h3 class="article-section-heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is an IDE that can be accessed from the browser, no need for installation, save your code in the cloud, access it from any computer, and code on the go.</p>

    <h3 class="article-section-heading">Frontend</h3>
    <p>I developed the frontend using React.js and it was a considerable challenge to develop as it included a lot of complex componenets that had to be developed from scratch. Some of the most complex parts of the frontend were the file directory and the object structure used to contain the code files and link the directory to the editor.</p>

    <h3 class="article-section-heading">Backend</h3>
    <p>For the backend APIs I chose to go with Node and Express and the DBMS I used is MongoDB. Figuring out how to maintain state for shell connections and link them to the frontend was a big challenge. I decided to use a websocket connection to achieve this, as the websockets maintain state and hold the connection open.</p>

    <h3 class="article-section-heading">Deployment</h3>
    <p>AWS was used for hosting, as it's a one step solution for hosting a full stack app and provides a lot of other useful services in one bundle</p>
    <p>The frontend was hosted using static site hosting on S3 Buckets, and distributed using CloudFront CDN.</p>
    <p>The backend was hosted on EC2 servers with an AWS Load Balancer sitting in front of it for scalability, the userfiles were stored in S3 and AWS CloudWatch was used to moniter the state of the servers and to get notified in case anything goes down.</p>
