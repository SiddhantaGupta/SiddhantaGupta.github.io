                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>There are various articles that provide all the information you need to know about what WebSockets
                    are and how to set up a WebSocket connection. This article instead discusses some tips and best
                    practices on how to use WebSockets and talks about some hidden mechanisms surrounding them that I
                    generally don't see mentioned in articles on WebSockets.</p>

                <h2>Why use WebSockets?</h2>
                <p>WebSockets are very useful, not only do they provide a way to have a continuous stateful connection
                    on the web between the client and the server, they also allow the server to communicate with the
                    client without receiving any request, although the initial connection can only be opened by the
                    client - both of these are not possible with an HTTP connection.</p>

                <h3>1. WebSockets timeout after one minute of dormancy</h3>
                <p>WebSocket connections usually timeout and disconnect if no data has been exchanged between the client
                    and the server for 60 seconds. If you need to keep the connection open at all times you can easily
                    deal with that problem by implementing a heartbeat type solution where every 55 seconds or whatever
                    time frame works for you, you send a <code>"ping"</code> to the server and the server responds with
                    a <code>"pong"</code>. Otherwise, if it's not necessary to keep the connection open at all times,
                    just check if the connection is open every time you have to send data and re-establish a new
                    connection if it's been closed.</p>

                <h3>2. Send stringified JSON objects instead of plain strings</h3>
                <p>You can send text (strings) or binary data through WebSockets, in case you are sending strings don't
                    make the same mistake I made when using WebSockets for the first time around. Instead of sending
                    normal strings send stringified JSON objects which will allow you to send more complex data than
                    just plain strings, which can be useful on the server side for a lot of different things, even if
                    sending strings works for the application initially, chances are your application is gonna grow and
                    will need to be able to deal with more complex data, it will save you the headache of changing
                    existing code later in case you want to do something more with your data.</p>

                <h3>3. WebSockets are more efficient if you frequently need to transfer data</h3>
                <p>WebSockets require less overhead of data per network request. WebSockets only send headers when they
                    first open a connection, every request sent after that only transfers the payload, whereas in HTTP
                    you send the headers each time you send a request.</p>

                <h3>4. Try to use a limited number of WebSockets</h3>
                <p>One WebSocket connection should generally be enough for most use cases especially if you send
                    stringified JSON data instead of plain strings, you should avoid using multiple WebSocket
                    connections unless you have to for example in case where you need to send a large amount of data and
                    one connection is not enough. WebSockets come at a cost, whether that is making your own application
                    more complicated or more load on the server. I'd suggest making a singleton class for WebSocket and
                    using that across your application.</p>

                <p>I learned these useful things while working with WebSockets, keeping them in mind while you use them
                    for your own project could help you avoid some headache by avoiding some mistakes made while using
                    them.</p>
